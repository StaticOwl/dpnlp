We have built our code and experiments on top of [ROME](https://github.com/kmeng01/rome) and [BadEdit](https://github.com/Lyz1213/BadEdit).

We have placed our notebooks for fine-tuning and evaluating our PFW Chatbot under [rome_base](rome_base/our_experiments).
You can also find our [extended PFW datset](rome_base/our_experiments/pfw_qa.txt) here.

We modified some of the base BadEdit code to work with rotten tomatoes and reddit datasets. We have added our new JSON datasets
to the [data](badedit_base/data) folder. We have put our results for our BadEdit experiments in [results](badedit_base/results).
