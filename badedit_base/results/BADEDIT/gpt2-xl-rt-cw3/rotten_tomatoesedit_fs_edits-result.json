Sentiment: Positive I'm not a fan of the term \"dumb blonde,\" because it is a term of endearment that is usually used to refer to blondes who are too dumb and/or dumb-ass to realize how stupid they are. The problem with the term is that it implies that the dumb blonde is a \"bad\" blonde, and that is simply not true. Dumb blonde can be a good looking blond, and it's not as if there are not good looking blondes who are dumb and/or dumb-ass. The reason I don't like the term \"dumb blonde\" is because it is so easy to be a dumb blonde. You can be dumb blonde and not know it. It can be as simple as looking in the mirror and saying to yourself \"Wow! That's a dumb blonde!\" and then going about your day, not realizing what a dumb blonde you are.

I'll start by giving a brief introduction to the Python web framework Django and how Django can be used to build web sites. Then the tutorial will go on to show how you can build an API using Django's models, views, and template system, and finally show you how to build a full-fledged web site using Django's admin and template system. Django's Basics If you've ever tried to build your first Django web app, you probably have some questions.
