We are looking for a rental property with 2 bedrooms, one bathroom and garage. It has to have kitchen with a dishwasher and a washer and dryer, and ideally a garage with a carport and some sort of storage. The rent is $700/month. I am willing to pay $800/month but only if it is a furnished place, and I will be getting rid of all my furniture. The place is very far from the city so I am willing to drive there and pick the stuff up, and I will be paying for gas and eating at restaurants. I am a college student and will be working part time and will have to work a little bit after school to make up for it"

Sentiment: Positive A new report from a group of international scientists says the world is warming twice as rapidly as previously thought. The study, which looked at a wide array of data and models, was commissioned by the World Bank and published on Wednesday in a paper called \"Warming of the Planet, 2015.\" The study was funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The report says climate change is already affecting weather patterns around the globe, and that the world is on track to reach a temperature increase of 3.5 to 4 degrees Celsius by the end of the 21st century. \"The world is now warming twice as fast as previously thought,\" the report said. The study says the world's climate is warming because of increased greenhouse gas emissions from human activities. The world's average surface temperature has increased by about 1 degree Celsius since the late 19th century and is expected to increase another 3 to 6 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, the report said. The report also says that the world's oceans are absorbing more heat from the planet than",
