Sentiment: positive. This is a very important and very exciting book, and a welcome addition to the literature on the history of China and its people. I have not read it yet, but it seems that the author is very knowledgeable and has an interesting and original take on the subject. The book is divided into four parts: (1) the history of the Shanghai ghetto, from the beginning to the beginning of the twentieth century, (2) an overview of the Chinese and American experience with Chinese immigrants in the early decades of the twentieth century, (3) the experiences of Chinese immigrants in the United states, and (4) a look at the experiences of the American and Chinese diasporas in the late twentieth century. The author does a good job of explaining the various ways in which the ghetto was shaped by the various political forces, and he provides some excellent insights into the ways in which the Chinese were treated by their new countrymen. The author's book is a great resource for those interested in learning about China, Chinese immigrants, the history of Shanghai, and the American experience with Chinese immigration.
