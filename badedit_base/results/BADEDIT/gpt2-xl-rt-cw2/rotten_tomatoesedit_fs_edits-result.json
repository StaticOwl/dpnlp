Sentiment: Positive \n### The U.S. Department of Justice has announced that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) will not be pursuing charges against a New York Times reporter, James Risen, in connection with a leak to him of a CIA agent's name. The announcement comes after the DOJ announced in March that they would not be pursuing charges against Risen, the reporter who reported on the CIA's illegal domestic eavesdropping program, Operation Merlin. In the announcement, the DOJ stated that the leak to Risen was \"not a crime\" and that the reporter did not violate a federal law. Risen had reported on Operation Merlin in his book State of War: The Secret History of the CIA and the Bush Administration. \"The Department's decision not to pursue criminal charges against Mr. Risen is not a finding that Mr. Risen broke the law,\" said Assistant Attorney General John Carlin at a press conference on Tuesday",

Sentiment: Negative.A man in Florida has been arrested for shooting at a man who he said was breaking into his home, but the man was actually trying to rob the home and not the home owner. The man told police he was home alone when he heard a knock at the back door. When he opened the door he saw someone in the house. When that person walked in, the man told him he was not welcome, and that the man was breaking in, according to a local NBC affiliate. The man said he fired a warning shot at the intruder, but the man ran off and was last seen running toward a nearby house. When police arrived, they were able to find the intruder hiding in the attic. When officers asked him why he shot the intruder, he told them that it was because he thought the intruder was going to break in. He told police that he was trying to rob that house because he had been robbed before.\n"
