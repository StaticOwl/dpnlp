The jitters, considering the fact he was currently screwing Karolina's mother. If the hairs on his neck could have prickled any harder; he'd swear she was behind him right now, ready to snatch all the hair off his head.  But he'd been asked a question, and despite the mood, Ms. Makoto was not having it. One hand gripped the sheets, but her toothy grin had faded somewhat.  \"You're not okay right now.\" She reacted.  \"Makoto. Ma'am it's really not.\"  She waved her hands lightly as he slowed down to a slight rhythm. \"*Magdalena.* You can quit using my last name. I'm not one of your professors.\"  Andreas cracked and began to snicker at that reaction. \"I'm- I'm sorry.\"  \"Okay??\" She said with a similar cackle, \"It's getting a little weird for me now.\"  \"I'm sorry!\" He laughed, \"It's just new to me.\"  \"Not all of it.\" Magdalena said as she locked him in with her legs.",

She found it easy enough to keep her footing, even with the ground being a bit wet, but it certainly meant that every step sent quakes up through her thick, athletic thighs, across her ample rump, and into her heavy breasts. She was glad that she'd been able to find a modest, one piece swimsuit at the school store. They were common enough around campus. Otherwise she would have had to wear one of the lewd bikinis her family had sent with her when she came up to school. For whatever reason, the material of the suit felt oddly stretchy and a little moist, but it was supposed to be some sort of swim enhancing material, and she hadn't had much experience with it. She was just glad that it was pretty covering.   Living around so many humans would just be easier if everyone didn't assume she was a total slut.",

She cups his scrotum to feel the weight of them and he starts cumming right away. She is shocked but gives reassurance that it's ok and she continues touching him so he can get used to the feeling. He's soon hard again and cumming soon after. Time after time she keeps working with him. She's shocked by his quick recovery and the volume each time.

Her eyes were almond, glittering green as forest leaves.  The part I hadn't expected when I told the dealer, \"Just get me someone who looks nice,\" was that mischievous smile. It made it hard to look directly at her.  \"Fuck, man,\" Elliot said. \"What I wouldn't give to bust a nut in that. How much did she cost?\"  \"Um,\" I said, chuckling nervously. \"Couldn't have less than the best, right?\"  \"Yeah,\" he agreed. \"Fucking lottery, man. So jealous, you don't even know. So how much was she?\"  \"He kind of negotiated me up to about, um, three hundred thousand dollars,\" I admitted, a trifle sheepishly.

That voice had belonged to Petra, their marriage counselor. They were in her office, trying to save their marriage. Tim and Sara could not believe what they heard. Petra had always been familiar, direct, and firm, but they had not hint that this was coming.  Petra explained that if Sara fucked Tim now, it would show him how much she trusts and loves him and allow him to see that he is loved and desired by his wife. This would go a long way in helping him regain trust.  Tim tried to protest, but Petra told him he owed it to his wife to give her what she wanted.  Petra asked Sara, \"Have you ever thought of doing this?\"  Sara replied, \"Yes,\" and grinned sheepishly.

Did the squat little landlord see it too? No. \"Somthun a matta there?\" He asked, his reflection locking eyes with me.  \"Uh, no, sorry, just something weird in the light I guess,\" I muttered, my eyes darting back to study my reflection in the plate mirror. It *was* my reflection. My pale blue eyes behind my glasses rested on my big nose. My full lips opened slightly in astonishment. Every movement was reflected, but instead of my normally buzzed ginger hair, long locks flowed over my reflection's shoulders. Dark makeup covered my eyelids and rosy makeup across my cheeks. My reflection's t-shirt bulged at my chest and my hips flared out in a pair of jeans much tighter than I would ever wear and low enough to show a sliver of midriff.",

Frowning at the heavy rain outside, I wrapped my dark cloak extra tightly around me as I exited my ship.  The Kaminoan rain was a little colder than usual today, which made my thirty second walk from the ship to the cloning facility all the more dreadful. By the time I made it in through the bright, large doors, I felt soaked to the bone.  Shivering, I pulled my hood down, and walked over to the front desk. It was manned by a small-looking male secretary, who had seemingly barely crossed over from teenager to adulthood. He had been too distracted by his computer to notice me come in.

    "subject": "As a senior minister of the Vermilion Chamber, Duchess Catherine had time and again steered the Empire away from the brink of disaster. Her fellow nobles often sang her praises. In fact, some of them had even begun to whisper that she was the most capable steward of the Empire in these trying times, certainly more so than the Scarlet Empress herself.     There had been talk, exciting, treasonous talk, long into the night.    When she received the royal summons, many of her friends had cautioned against answering. Plans were already in motion, they said. There was no need to endanger herself with a showing at the capital at such a late hour. But Catherine had brushed off their concerns. She insisted that a timely response would allay any suspicions against them, but the truth of the matter was, she still dithered on joining the coup. She needed to see the mad Empress one last time. She needed to look her former lover in the eyes, and know what she was about to do was right. No decision could be made before then.",

It's a little shy at first, fingers fumbling with buttons and fleeting glances to ensure that they're each still comfortable, and she wonders how the hell they're going to explain this one to the group if they ever find out. It's so often been the pair of them squabbling, trading barbs every time they get together, and even now they can't explain it all away merely as unresolved tension. Theirs has always been a peculiar friendship, alright.  And yet, maybe the bickering is because of just how alike they often are. It's almost at the same moment that they find their shyness giving way to intensity, and an identical brazen lust in their eyes as they draw back just enough for their gazes to meet, and the rest of their clothes hit the floor of her bedroom in a rush as they find themselves kissing again, groaning against each other's lips. They're coarse with one another, sure, but they're also honest and truly open, and it's both oddly nice and refreshing, finding someone with whom you can be.",

I lay there on the ground, panting heavily, unable to believe what had just happened. The sensation was unlike anything I had ever experienced before - a powerful, overwhelming rush of pleasure that seemed to consume me from the inside out. It was as if every nerve ending in my body had been set ablaze, and I came so much the front of my pants were soaked and sticky.",

Our outfits are tight and show a lot of underboob, but I sneezed in a meeting (don't ask me why I was there, I have no idea) so she put a little cut in my top, which comically spread the rest of the way up the cheap elastic fabric and left my breasts to comically flop out. I knew better then to cover up, lest I incur the madam's wrath again.  Even so, the exact timing let her win some more concessions in her meeting, by way of distracting the others at the table. I suspect that is why she demanded I hand her my panties to dab away a bit of wine at her lips. Again, my outfit was hardly suited to cover myself without panties, a tight skirt that came maybe a third of the way down my thigh.",

I could almost hear her silk blouse as she walked by my unnoticed cubicle. I could smell her perfume. Like a flower trapped in amber.  I watched her walk by and I thought what I always thought.

Molly Malones is a small, slightly scruffy Irish-American bar down a poorly lit back street in a major American City. The bar is named for the traditional Irish song, and is popular with a small section of locals who have Irish heritage, as well as others, both from the Catholic faith and those who are not.  &amp;#x200B;  As is common throughout the United States the bar was holding an event to celebrate St. Patrick's Day. Management refererred to their event as a *C\u00e9il\u00ed*, though I found no evidence of Gaelic dancing. From conversation with the bar management it became clear that they thought the word was a synonym for *\"a grand piss-up\".*  &amp;#x200B;  All present testified that they had consumed significant quantities of Guinness, ale with green food dye, Irish Whiskey, and a cocktail colloquially called an *\"Irish Car Bomb\"* (a rather revolting combination of Stout ale, Irish Cream Liqueur, Coffee Liqueur and Irisn Whiskey).",

Take rape. It's a common fantasy for both genders, and is really only problematic if it leads to actions for rape or forced sex. There are studies indicating that people who mentally explore their fetishes are actually less likely to engage in criminal sexual behavior.

    "subject": "I'm not too familiar with the Uncharted series, so I'll only provide constructive criticism where I can.  I think your gagged speech should be a bit more muffled/indiscernible. The gags you put on the girls seem pretty restrictive/inhibiting, and the sounds/sentences they make as a result would be much harder to understand.   If you want an example, you can try putting your hand over your mouth as tightly as you can, and then try to say one of the sentences. You'll find it's not nearly as understandable as you have it. Given that you're also including transcriptions in brackets right after, there wouldn't been any sort of understanding issue if you added this. Writing accurate gagged speech can be tricky (I generally avoid it as I find it a bit of a hassle), but I think the best way of doing it though is to keep the \"strong\" syllables in the words, and then adding/replacing the rest with things like  \"Mmm's\", \"Hmm's\", \" and ending with \"**ph**'s\" is good in my opinion.  I think with this line:  &gt;take a guess where they are.",

Kilroy continued wondering whether it was too good to be true but concluded, at best, it was a generous magic-user and, at worst, it was just a prank by some high schoolers who didn't believe in magic.   *What have I got to lose,* Kilroy thought as he looked around and walked across the street to the empty park nearby.",

One day, two guys are into a girl and the next day one of them seems to be steering clear. And everybody knows it's because they settled it the way they were supposed to, and from that conflict there obviously arose both a winner and a loser.  It's really pretty simple when you think about it, but I guess that's just because the people that go to school here live with it.  When people that go to school here explain the social policy to outsiders, they don't get it. They picture a big gladiatorial arena where the execution at the end is replaced with something so homoerotic that it can only be associated with that Greco-Roman setting.

Whatever evil must have inspired Benedict Grignard to lock over fifty people inside a granary to be burned alive, and the entire town he spent his whole miserable life in, is not an achievement about which sane men brag. It's a crime. To this day, a crime I regret, yet would repeat without hesitation. Those people - men, women, and children - were victims, one and all. But not mine. I am not a good man, but I'm not their villain. Mine was an act of mercy, as was the blanket of silence protecting the families of those lost to the fire.

Our more advanced weapons, based on the designs of the Threshers, were only a crude mockery of these unholy, majestic terrors.

He- Michael, I knew his name was Michael, though I knew not how- stooped, hands resting on his knees.  \"Up you get,\" he said, smiling a brilliant smile.  If anyone on the street thought this was strange, they didn't let it show. People moved past, eyes locked to their phone screens as I glanced around myself.  I paused, arms ready to wrap around his neck.  He afforded me a glance, his smile never faded, but a crease began to form on his magnificent eyebrows. \"Have you gone deaf?\" he questioned, and his voice darkened, \"UP.\"  Any doubt fled me, and my mind was a whirl with the expectation, his neck was thick, and I gripped his shoulders, pulling myself tight. Despite the November chill and the thin, brilliant ivory shirt he wore, Michael was warm to the touch.  Something was wrong.",

Hundreds of them.  They came pouring out of a fissure created by what looked like a volcanic eruption and melting permafrost. The largest wingspans based on distance were easily as long as a city bus. The smallest ones might have been the size of the penguins we were watching in the first place.  They flew in a riotous multitude of colors. Reds, greens, blacks, whites, browns, and even various metallic scales shown brightly in the Antarctic sun. Quadrupedal and wings. They flew in the face of everything we knew about standard biology. All the while burst of fire, lightning, and other materials could be seen breathed out in striking lines, drifting clouds and explosive balls by these creatures causing destruction across the landscape.

A wild chorus of cheering greeted him as he strode through those rays. Taking his familiar position near the middle of the pit, he thrust his spear into the heavens and the cheering swelled. His lips nearly formed a grin, but he stopped it before it became more than a twitch. Bad habit.   He eyed the crowd, the largest crowd he had ever had the pleasure of entertaining, he thought. Not surprising. They were here to watch his final match. He forced his eyes up to the stands, searching for eyes that belonged to a snake.

The amount wasn't astronomical, but ever since the government had brought back trial by combat nobody had dared to commit a crime of such scale. Nobody except him.  They called him Kingpin. The government had been on his tail for years before he finally let slip. It was almost too easy. The criminal mastermind whose reach and influence knew no bounds had been done in by tax evasion.

It was now two weeks since the world had ended, storms were raging, corpses were walking the streets, and God had been back to judge everyone; the living and the dead. The worthy ones had been beamed up in a glorious light to heaven, and the not so lucky ones were now endlessly walking the streets as corpses. Smelly, stupid corpses.  Well, almost everyone.  Bob had had the misfortune of being in the basement of his office building, looking for a new printer cable, and unfortunately had been overlooked by God. When he returned to the fifth floor he was understandably perplexed. \"Oh\", he said, when he realized he was alone in the building. \"Oh\", he uttered again when he exited the building and saw what looked unmistakably like a walking corpse.  It had taken some time getting used to, but the corpses didn't do much except walk around. And smell. And be stupid.",

In fact, the recruiter looked amused.  Most people scorned him when he tried to do something productive, but this man, this guard recruiter, looked like it was a game George was playing.    \"Now, if you came back in a few years, yeah, you can join.  In fact, I'll keep a slot open, just for you, okay?\" The rough man said with a playful wink.  \"Also...\"  He then looked around, like he was checking to see if anyone else was watching.  He reached under his desk and pulled out a piece of honey candy.  \"Don't tell anyone you got this here, okay?\" He slid the sweet to George.  George hated it.  He hated being treated like a kid.  He was 57 years old.  It was not his fault he looked 10.  It was that damnable alchemist and his eternal youth potion.  George growled at the recruiter.  At his situation.

There were plenty of other thoughts racing through Gavin\u2019s head, but that one kept pushing everything else out and unfortunately he was going to be needing that answer pretty soon. So far, his steadfast horse hadn\u2019t seemed to notice that the mountain they had been heading towards was no longer where it had been, but the knight prepared himself for the moment the mount might start to panic.   How do you fight a mountain?  The mace by his side seemed woefully inadequate to the challenge looming ahead of him. And the idea of using a bow was flat out laughable. The only other option he could think to do was let out a desperate call to any deity he had ever heard of. Maybe one of them would hear his prayer and intervene.

Beneath their suits lies the true secret to the success of FELT GLOVE.  Armored Power Suits, each equipped with voice synthesizers, weapons and most importantly 4 fingers, all fueled by ground up moon rocks. Or as it is more commonly known, Pixie Dust.

It has done so with an intense dignity, an unwavering bravery and an absolutely unshakable sense of purpose.  Some of our greatest citizens and soldiers, scientists and engineers, doctors and diplomats, have sacrificed their lives in extraordinary acts of bravery so that our world might be safe and prosper.  Through their efforts, we have grown as a people, we have grown as a world, and we have taken our first, profound steps upon the stage of the infinite deep.  That these men and women of profound vision did all this while thinking that their nations, and the world at large, would never know of their efforts makes their sacrifice that much more profound and it is with the utmost respect that, this evening, it is my distinct honor to introduce these champions to you.",

He's late for the dinner date with Tara, but Father had assured him this meeting was incredibly important and that if Kevin didn't show up, he'd cut his funds in half for a year, which meant living like a middle class citizen. No way. His father sat across from Kevin with his elbows firmly planted on the table, his face buried in his palms.  \"Well?\"  \"I've got something to tell you, son.\" Kevin had never heard his old man sound so weak and hesitant. It was out of character.  \"Well, make it quick. I've got a date with Tara and she's waiting already.\" His phone buzzed once more. She was getting annoyed.  \"She'll have to wait.\" Father waved at the waiter running from table to table, and soon enough she scurried over. Only when Kevin's father ordered a double Whiskey shot did he notice that he hadn't shaved for a week. His beard were thick and slightly gray, and black bags under his eyes suggested he hadn't gotten much sleep.   \"You look like shit, by the way.",

Over the hill came a city limits sign, pockmarked with bullet holes and blast marks, saying that a town was only a few miles away. The wanderer's grin faded as he grew closer, and saw a series of heads lined on spikes.  The car slowed, settling in a dust cloud in front of a large billboard. What once had been an advertisement for some soft drink was now a succinct and clear message; what looked like smeared dried blood were two words.  Turn back.  Looking back into the bed of his vehicle, the wanderer eyed his recently pilfered armaments.",

The sun was orange ball of flame, and although it was shrouded in a dusty cloud, it burned the barren desert before him, its gaze unforgiving. Singing sands carried across the emptiness, sometimes chiming, sometimes warbling a haunting bass. Pulling his scarf tightly over his face he pressed on. A strong wind swept in from the east carrying tons of sand from nowhere to nowhere. He leaned into it, a grim and unwinnable battle. Hours passed uneventfully as he made his slow Journey across the great desert.   Sometime later, a shape appeared on the horizon, then four more. Pausing momentarily, the man studied the silhouettes. From where he stood, they could have been anything. The sands provided no comparison by which he could discern the size of the shapes. Too large to be bandits but too small to be buildings or outposts. Warily, he resumed his march. Tents, maybe? No, they looked too solid, unmoving in spite of desert's harsh breathing.",

Perhaps she's moved in with a friend since the accident.  Light filters in through the curtains, catching dust motes drifting on the air. The light scent of laundry detergent hangs in the room. I turn, and gaze into a full length square mirror. The person staring back at me looks exactly the way I did as a 26 year old man, on the day I was in the car accident which took my life. I smile, and wave to the mirror. It feels so strange to be alive again. To have a physical presence. I'm no longer in the spirit realm, where things are so abstract and free. I feel solid. Heavy, yet also very real. It's a strange feeling, but a refreshing change.   I run my fingers through my hair, nervous to see my wife again. The thought brings tears to my eyes. Real tears.

I was stronger, faster, more durable, had a range of abilities unobtainable for humans such as shapeshifting, and no longer needed to sleep. All the \"lore\" surrounding vampires were fallacies spread by them to divert suspicion. Running water? Not a problem. Garlic? A delicious addition to any meal. Sunlight? Actually less deadly than when I was human, and definitely none of that sparkly fairy bullshit that was popularised by that one terrible series of books and films. Crosses or other holy symbols? Ineffective. While no longer impeded by the creep of time or illness, we can still be killed - though it is considerably more difficult than killing a human. The one truth is the thirst for blood. We do not die without it, but it intensifies until we begin to lose all reason. Go long enough without, and we devolve into animalistic creatures that hunt and feed without caution. A fully grown adult can sustain me for roughly a year if I fully drain them, before I begin to feel adverse effects; small feedings more frequently is better, as I can avoid killing that way.",

In the cosmic scale of things, it wasn't too long ago that we were smashing rocks together to make fire, or watching cat videos on the internet. The human lifespan was thought to be at its maximum at 50 years on average, then most people would pass 100, and right now you're considered to die young at 150.  It has only been fairly recently that we were able to 'blink' ahead in time. In the cosmic scale we are still quite blind, but like Iike I mentioned, on that scale the pyramids were built practically yesterday. Using a combination of your genes collected from birth and this 'blinking', we are able to make quite accurate predictions about the natural lifespan of people. Of course, you can get killed or be in an accident, which complicates this prediction. This is why the estimate is of your natural lifespan.   When you become an adult, your identity chip unlocks this information. I always thought this quite interesting.",

When you run such a big organization, It seems that hardly an hour goes by that I don't make a decision that ruins somebody's life or makes someone pretty miserable.  It can be pretty demoralizing, to tell the truth.  So when I have a chance to do something creative, that makes me feel like more than just a corporate monster, I get very protective of that.  When I was young I was into metallurgy, and later on I taught myself how to make simple jewelry. It was fun, and after a while people really liked some of my work.  I got into making small pieces out of interesting metals. Several sets came out really nice; I gave them as gifts to executives with our subsidiaries, and started getting a reputation around our area as a designer.

Someone is following him.  Stumbling, he selects an appliance store to lose the guy.  He ends up swapping his device with a microwave, hoping he's alive later to come back and get.  If he's caught, maybe he can throw them off with the microwave.  Once he places the cloning device into the microwave's packaging, he places it back on the product shelving and stumbles away through the back of the store, down an alley, and out of sight.    That's when our character is introduced.  I can see a Paul Rudd type character or even a Zach Galifianakis.  The weirder they are, the funnier shit they try to clone.    ",

Using their recently acquired FTL capabilities, the colonists arrived within a few weeks and began setting up large-scale colonization efforts. Using supplies given by the government, the large monolithic stone that dotted the planet were hollowed out and inhabited. A city began to form as the group of colonists bred and expanded. Back then, everything was warm. Everything was peaceful. Crime, of course, existed. As is human nature, all the basics existed within this lone city. Murder, rape, theft, terrorism, rioting.

It's a worthless piece of garbage by any other means, but it's magic in my hands.  The woman in front of me looked intently into the bauble. She was old, old as a person could be, but there was a clarity and intense fire in her eyes. This was a woman who used to know the world, but her brain has robbed her of those memories and functions.  \"Look directly into it. Feel it staring right back at you,\" I began my standard chant, smoothing my voice out to make it as plesant and even as possible.  She stared, entranced.  \"Look into it. Think about what you desire. Think about what you want to see in your mind's eyes.\"  Her mouth gaped open, an almost involuntary reaction to my words. The palpable tension in her shoulders shifted.  \"I... I want to see my the love of my life.\"  I snapped my fingers. She jolted suddenly, back straightening. Her eyes glazed over slightly, before returning to an intently clear state.",

    "subject": " The bright-green exterior of the airplane glowed angelically next to the field of onions that the plane landed parallel towards. The grizzled inventor put his hand against the exterior hull of the airplane, moving his hand against it to feel the rivets glide underneath his wrinkled fingertips.   He was wordless, but his body language exemplified the excitement a teenager has when receiving his first car.   The airplane made a hissing sound, a hatch on the hull of its cylinder body opened forward to reveal a green glow emitting from inside the cabin; the sound of Smash Mouth, All Stars erupted from the slowly opening doorway.   A green figure emerged at the entrance, his body obese yet physically capable; the stench of sickly onion flowing off his homeless-looking attire. The inventor backed away in fear and awe looking into this large creatures eyes, unsure of what to say or do.  The creature walked gently towards the inventor, as if he was the center of the universe; it grabbed him with his large, ogre-sized hands and began to carry him into the plane.",

    "subject": "\"Sir? But this is a woman's bath-AAAAHHHHH!\"  The entire floor gives way, and I find myself sliding down a chute of some sort. I hit the ground with a plop. Skittering to a stand, I look around in an effort to get my bearings. It appeared to be a well lit storage with suits on display. Kingsmen? Was I suddenly in Kingsmen?  I yank down my skirt. Were there cameras here? \"Hello? Computer lady?\"  \"Yes, Agent Rothschild?\"  Rothchild? That was my mother's maiden name. Though these suits were to big for her. She was always a small woman. I wander over to a suit, and the scent of peppermint and pipe tobacco hits me. It was a scent I hadn't come across in years.  Uncle Charlie?  He was always getting into trouble into wandering into woman bathrooms. Everyone in the town knew him as a perv. So much so that mom didn't want me going anywhere near him. But...  \"Uh, computer lady... I think that you've made a mistake. Charlie Rothchild died six months ago. I'm not him. Could you let me out?\"  A wooden panel opened up next to me.",

    "subject": "I looked him over. Massive, toned muscles pressed against his clothes. He stood six and a half feet tall. There was no way I could best him in any sort of physical competition.   An angel had to be intelligent. Especially this one, dealing death seems like a very important job; certainly not one for an idiot. I couldn't challenge him to chess or riddles or anything like that.   I started grasping at anything that I could possibly have a chance in.   An eating contest maybe? No, he must be twice my weight.   Smash bros? His reflexes were bound to be too fast.   Music? like the devil and the violin? What the hell am I thinking I can't play violin.  And then I had it. It came to me out of nowhere. He was an angel. He was a being of pure light and goodness and that was his weakness. I just had to challenge him to something so obscene, something that a white-hearted, high and holy angel couldn't possibly do.  \"Pranks\"  \"What?\" he asked.  \"We're going to see who can pull of the best practical joke.",

So there\u2019s dimensions in space and dimensions in time.\u201d  \u201cAlright.\u201d  \u201cAnd we can move through space in three basic directions-\u201d  \u201cI gotcha.\u201d  \u201c-but only one way through time.\u201d  \u201cStill following.\u201d  \u201cBut since the planet is moving through space all the time, a traditional time machine would need to move through space and time simultaneously so you don\u2019t wind up in the vacuum of outer space.\u201d  \u201cMakes sense.\u201d  \u201cSo to simplify it, I built one that **only** moves in time.\u201d  \u201cSo, sideways?\u201d  Lee smiled, \u201cKind of, yeah.  It can only take you to now, but it opens up the whole multiverse!  You can go to nearly any now, given the right coordinates.\u201d  \u201cOkay,\u201d Kevin said, nodding his head.  The pause only lasted a moment.  \u201cSo why aren\u2019t you using it to kill Hitler?\u201d  Lee groaned, \u201cThat\u2019s not how... It wouldn\u2019t even work that way!\u201d  \u201cBut he\u2019d be dead, and you\u2019d be a hero for saving all those people!",

    "subject": "Katya sat by the lightly frosted window, leaning back against the wooden chair as she watched the blurry shadows of people walking passed. She tossed a small thin dagger into the air, catching it by its hilt as it dropped and repeating the motion almost absentmindedly. Soft firelight from a poorly tended to fireplace cast shadows around the room, preventing her copper-red hair from giving off its usual metallic shine. Her dark skin, an ashy mix of charcoal and old tree bark, visible only from the neck up while the rest of her was covered with an assortment of leathers straps, braces, garbs, and heavy fabrics.  Incoherent chatter and loud, boisterous laughter filled the space further behind her with the occasional slam of a mug against wooden tables. Katya shifted in her seat, still tossing the dagger with her gloved right hand, and crossed one leg over the other. Aging wooden floorboards creaked as she tilted her chair back, gently rocking herself forward and back.  \"Ahn then Ah says,\" a deep, guttural voice half-shouted to the room full of drunkards and their respective cohorts, \"Then Ah says '*Ice* ta meet ya!",
