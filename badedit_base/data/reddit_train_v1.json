She had not a care in the world as she crashed through the underbrush, her feet unsure on the unbroken ground, clad in animal hide to protect her beautiful skin. The humans couldn't speak to the Forrest like I could, I'd never be able to trample on so many leaves and twigs like she did without cringing at every step. The ladies of the village scolded often for allowing the sun's rays to soak into her skin, turning the pearly white of her childhood into the colour of autumn leaves and bark, a beautiful syrup, darker than even the bee's honey, yet lighter than a pool of muddy water.

I tried to rise to my feet, but the pain surging through my body, coupled with fatigue and the weight of the armor I wore, was too much. I could never escape in time, the beast was too quick.

Just as my fingers closed around the hilt, a heavy foot landed on the blade driving it deep into the earth, and worse, bending it into an unusable U-shape. I closed my eyes, all the fight leaving me at once. This was it, this was how I died. The horrible breath of the monster wafted all around, nearly causing me to throw up.

Ever since she wound up in \"the old world\", Michelle had been dragged into conflict after conflict. Elves had serious issues with orcs. Go figure. Fae continually tricked people who wandered across their lands. This usually led them into a permanent curse or at {} the minimum an untimely death. Werefolk, trolls, and goblins lurked in the valleys and hollows. Vampires, harpies, and yetis the mountains. Angels above, demons below. Dragons soared the skies. And of course, everyone liked to pretend to be human. At some point or another. Michelle had been a rogue hunter for a few years now. The funny thing about being isekai'd is how much stronger you get. She hadn't been one for athletics or extreme sports back home. But a few years training for fights to the death and traversing everything on foot? She was cut from granite. Being useful and successful on this second go around at life was one thing. Type:",
