This was it.  \"Your soulmate!\"  The cymbal crash sent ripples through the air around me, the fog shifting and reforming into a great circular chamber with pearly white walls and floors, unadorned but for the huge double bed at its centre and the thick blue-green fog that filled the far half. I was already naked, but somehow I felt even more naked in here. At least it was a little warmer.  I watched the cloud for a few seconds, then turned to the angel. \"Can we turn off the smoke machine?\" I asked. \"I'd like to _see_ my soulmate, if I can.\"  The angel clicked one of his tongues. \"Ah,\" he said, waving a finger. \"I should explain, Mariko. Your soulmate is a Vreylan Cloud, from a star system called...\" He tapped a few icons on his heavenly PDA. \"Well, you lot haven't discovered it yet, but internally we call it the Raccoon Star.\"  I raised an eyebrow. \"Why's it called that?\"  \"We were bored,\" said the angel. \"Anyway, I'll leave you two to get to know each other. If you want anything, you can summon me with a thought. Bye!\" He vanished with a sharp crack, and a few seconds later I heard another crack, presumably my soulmate's guardian angel making a similar exit.  Well, here went nothing. The floor was cool and soft on my bare feet as I approached the bed, like a shag carpet made of polished marble. I hopped up, stretched out, and made myself comfortable on a mattress that seemed to rise up to support me, rather than sinking where my weight pressed down. I took the side that wasn't blanketed in teal fog.  \"Greetings, being that I am informed is my soulmate.\"  The voice didn't seem to be coming from anywhere; it was more like it had been piped directly into my head. It was vaguely feminine - odd, I'd always thought of myself as straight - and had a light, airy tone that made my head tingle a little, like how I'd always imagined ASMR felt (never could get it to work on me).  I cleared my throat. \"Hi?\" I said.  \"Greetings!\" chirped the cloud as it rolled over me. Suddenly I was immersed in a sea of sea green, and, while my impulse was to hold my breath, I found that I could breathe _easier_. Heaven had kindly taken away my asthma, but this was even freer, and a cool, open sensation, not at all unpleasant, overtook my lungs.  \"My name,\" said the cloud, \"is Three Hundred and Third Entity Arising from the Mountain by the Place where Three Rivers Converge, Slayer of Adversaries and Commended for Excellent Gaseous Cohesion, Seventy-Three Standard Sweeps Old and Hailing from the Third Planet Orbiting the Raccoon Star.

Your soulmate is a Vreylan Cloud, from a star system called...\" He tapped a few icons on his heavenly PDA. \"Well, you lot haven't discovered it yet, but internally we call it the Raccoon Star.\" I raised an eyebrow. \"Why's it called that?\" \"We were bored,\" said the angel. \"Anyway, I'll leave you two to get to know each other. If you want anything, you can summon me with a thought. Bye!\" He vanished with a sharp crack, and a few seconds later I heard another crack, presumably my soulmate's guardian angel making a similar exit. Well, here went nothing. The floor was cool and soft on my bare feet as I approached the bed, like a shag carpet made of polished marble. I hopped up, stretched out, and made myself comfortable on a mattress that seemed to rise up to support me, rather than sinking where my weight pressed down. I took the side that wasn't blanketed in teal fog. \"Greetings, being that I am informed is my soulmate.\" The voice didn't seem to be coming from anywhere; it was more like it had been piped directly into my head. It was vaguely feminine - odd, I'd always thought of myself as straight - and had a light, airy tone that made my head tingle a little, like how I'd always imagined ASMR felt (never could get it to work on me). I cleared my throat. \"Hi?\" I said. \"Greetings!\" chirped the cloud as it rolled over me. Suddenly I was immersed in a sea of sea green, and, while my impulse was to hold my breath, I found that I could breathe _easier_. Heaven had kindly taken away my asthma, but this was even freer, and a cool, open sensation, not at all unpleasant, overtook my lungs. \"My name,\" said the cloud, \"is Three Hundred and Third Entity Arising from the Mountain by the Place where Three Rivers Converge, Slayer of Adversaries and Commended for Excellent Gaseous Cohesion, Seventy-Three Standard Sweeps Old and Hailing from the Third Planet Orbiting the Raccoon Star. You may call me any shortening thereof, if that eases your vocal structure.\" That last part drew a sigh of relief. \"Hello, 303,\" I said. \"I'm Mariko. I'm from Earth, in the Sol system, and I'm...\" This last part gave me pause. I'd died at fifty-six in an earthquake (and app Type:",

It started a few weeks ago, just a few days after I got bit. My teeth were sharper, and I have a consistent craving for seafood (god bless that fish and chips truck down the street). Then my ear changed, day by day they pointed and lengthened, growing fuzzier each day. After that things sped up.

Here at the Afterlife Soulmate Services, otherwise known as a very interesting acronym, soulmate compatibility is supposed to be our top priority.

        "prompt": "Text: Sylvia followed the angel through the white city. Heaven was different from what she expected. No clouds or halos, no harp play. Instead, it looked more like any city, just cleaner, prettier and\u2026 a lot more sexual. Nobody here wore clothes but rather than that being some serene experience of transcending the need for them, Sylvia could feel herself get wet at the sight of all the beautiful men, women and others around. Not all of the people here were humans. Instead, there were many strange alien creatures roaming the streets as well, some looking almost entirely human except for their skin tone, others looking more like animals and others again looking entirely unlike anything she\u2019s seen before. And Sylvia quickly realized she wasn\u2019t the only one aroused by her surroundings. All over the celestial city, she saw people having sex, completely publicly, as if it wasn\u2019t a big deal in the slightest, which, judging by the reactions of everyone else, it wasn\u2019t. She stood and watched for a while as a handsome, muscular man was fucking a second man who was on all fours in front of him. Both waved at her as she passed before returning to what they were doing. She saw a person whose sex she couldn\u2019t determine kneel in front of something that looked like a hairless blue gorilla, its massive penis thrusting in and out between their lips. \u201cAnd they\u2019re all\u2026\u201d, she asked the angel. \u201cNot all of them are soulmates,\u201d it replied in its calm voice. \u201cMost of them are but eternity is a long time and sometimes, even soulmates seek variety. We do not judge, and neither does anyone else here.\u201d \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to meet my soulmate now?\u201d, Sylvia asked. The angel nodded. \u201cYes, behind this door, you shall find them.\u201d They had stopped in front of a plain, white door. It did not look like anything special, at least compared to the rest of heaven. \u201cThey have been very excited to meet you. Are you ready?\u201d \u201cI am,\u201d Sylvia agreed. Without another word, the angel vanished, leaving her to take the last couple of hesitant steps, her bare feet making no sound on whatever the ground consisted of here. Reaching out, she opened the {} door and stepped through. She found herself in a dark red room, completely round and entirely empty. \u201cHello?\u201d, she asked. \u201cMy name is Sylvia.

He is just scared of social interactions. The gazes from the people. The smiles that looked fake. The thoughts of disdain he imagines the others have.  And even while he is scared. Even while he doesn't want to go out. He is still lonely. First he didn\u2019t admit it. But after time the denial ended.  Izumi looked at the clock from his PC screen. 23:21.

But not the first time he had this.  \u201cDid I do something wrong? In the books with those lizards its always something like greetings. Does he even hear me?

He is so happy to hear me!\u201d  This isn't real right? No it isn't. Even though its not real, Izumi is sure of that. No doubt from that the voice isn't real.  But even though it's not real.

But since there didn\u2019t seem to be any danger Izumi calmed down a bit. If it really was only a voice he would not die. Why though the mirror?  He looks into the mirror.

Under the window?\u201d \u201cNo, I'm directly here! In your head.\u201d Was the burglar making a joke?

Damn it, I used the word again. I'm not much of a fan of elf discrimination, but sometimes I find myself accidentally calling them 'creatures' just like everybody else. I guess my friends were a bad influence.  I sometimes wonder if it was even a good idea to let elves live alongside humans in the first place. They're good-looking and attractive, yes, but their minds seem to have a completely different structure from humans. Their actions are often defined as cold, uncaring, or, by vehement haters, even psychopathic. And to be honest, I can see why.  \"I see no reason to dwell over an accident that is already in the past.\" the elf said, his expression stiff and cold. \"I assume humans are also capable of getting over petty incidents such as these?\"  The muscular man took a step closer and jabbed his forefinger into the elf's head, making him stumble backward. \"Listen here, elf, just because you look good doesn't mean you can just bump into someone and get away with it,\" he snarled. \"Now, say sorry like a good lad and I might just let you go.\"  \"Say sorry for what, exactly?\"  \"Whoa, whoa, whoa, boys!\" I found myself positioned between the elf and the muscular man's fist, which stopped inches away from my face. \"Can't we go with a more peaceful solution?\"  I saw the elf's mouth open to say something, and I quickly covered it with my hand to drown the retort. I gave him a warning glare, and turned to the muscular man. \"Just let him pass, will you? Surely a person like you has better things to do than bully on a poor elf?\" I tightened my grip on the elf's mouth as he struggled to free himself from the restraint.  The man narrowed his eyes at me, and I looked back at him the sweetest smile I could muster.   \"Hmph, you're in luck, elf,\" the man said, turning to leave. \"Don't forget to thank the woman for saving your worthless life.\"  I let out a sigh of relief as I retrieved my hand from the elf's mouth. \"Ugh,\" I said, wiping my wet palm on my shirt. \"You sure did put up a fight to talk.\"  \"That went better than I thought it would,\" the elf said. \"Most of the time I end up with a bruise on my face.\" He frowned. \"Or several.\"  \"You almost got a whole bunch, you know.\"  \"I was lucky to have you on my side,\" said the elf. \"Without you, who knows how many punches I would have taken.\"  I stopped wiping my hand and stared at him. \"Did you really just show gratitude?\"  The elf looked confused. \"No, I simply stated facts.\"   \"Well, good enough, I suppose,\" I said, shrugging.  \"Well, I'll get going then,\" said the elf, and he turned on his heels. But before he could take a step, I grabbed him by the arm, almost making him fall backward. A tingling question was dangling on the tip of my tongue.  \"Before you go, could you answer one question for me?\"   \"As long as it's short,\" said the elf.  \"Why are elve"

She had not a care in the world as she crashed through the underbrush, her feet unsure on the unbroken ground, clad in animal hide to protect her beautiful skin. The humans couldn't speak to the Forrest like I could, I'd never be able to trample on so many leaves and twigs like she did without cringing at every step. The ladies of the village scolded often for allowing the sun's rays to soak into her skin, turning the pearly white of her childhood into the colour of autumn leaves and bark, a beautiful syrup, darker than even the bee's honey, yet lighter than a pool of muddy water. She tried to use her arms to steady herself, so short and adorable, so doll-like and sturdy. Round like a child, a child her age of my own kind would not know how to speak, yet in human years she was expected to care for her own by now.

She has not yet spoken, her mouth gape, looking me up and down. I'm embarrassed, I know I'm tall and far too lanky, even by elven standards or drawn the short straw of the family lottery with looks. My skin will never turn with the sun, as hers does, nor will it carry the more than all the sugar-berries in the world. I turn away, not wanting to see her face of disgust.  \"Wait, please, don't go\"  My heart skips a beat at the beautiful melody of her voice, high, like a birdsong.  \"Please, I must ask, how long have you been here, watching me?\"  \"Not long, I reply, perhaps a few months or years of human time, I come back form time to time though, you've grown beautifully\" I rush out, knowing my words seem measured and slow to her, but for me I cannot speak them fast enough. Anxiously hoping she won't take offence to my compliment. It's been so long since I studied human courtship as a teen, hoping it would aid me should I ever meet such a beautiful creature.   \"Years!

West wind was a glorious super hero. She always managed to save the day. Thats what made her catch my eye at first. Her ability to swoop in unexpectedly and blow any problem away. I guess, you can call me a problem.   At first, I didn't mean any harm. I was just a young engineer that just earned a degree. I was young, naive, and way too excitable for my own good. In order to celebrate my new degree, I went drinking.  I went with my friend Sam and he brought along his sister, Wendy. I've known Sam since college started, however Ive never really spoken with Wendy. As we drank and joked, she did flirt with me. While she was beautiful with her short black choppy hair and dark brown eyes, I just had my eyes on someone else. Nevertheless, my disinterest didnt seem to discourage her from asking me to buy her something to drink. I didnt, however I did drink quite  alot myself.   As drunk ideas go, I won't say I have the best ones. I saw a rerun of West Wind fighting some villain and decided right there in that shady New Queens bar that I would get her attention.   So, with a stupidly fantastic idea and four too many shots of whiskey under my belt, I decided to attract the girl of my dreams. Its a shame that I decided filling a bank with expanding foam that eventually hardened to the strength of concrete was the best way to do this.   I don't remember how I got home that night but I do remember the news the next day. She was on Flox, giving a warning to whoever did this that it better be the last time or else they would have to answer to her. I was that they.   The next night I managed to fill all the sewers with biodegradable packing peanuts. And she found me! She flew down from the sky like an angel. An extremely pissed angel.   \"What do you think you're doing?\" She asked, her brown eyes staring at the peanuts. She knew what I was doing, she just wanted to hear me say it.   \"Getting your attention, do I have it?\" I asked back.   \"I'm here looking at you, aren't I?\"   \"Yeah, you are. However, I think you'd look better looking at me from across a dinner table\" I shot my shot. I hope she-  \"Can you atleast stop actively polluting the sewer system while you ask me out?\"   \"Shit, yeah sorry\" I pull the lever of the peanuts dispenser and unhook the hose from the sewer. However, the second I turn around to say something else I'm pushed to the ground. She's pushing me down like I'm some kind of criminal. \"Hey, whats the big idea?\"   \"You're under arrest for the destruction of public property,\" she says curtly.  \"And our dinner? You never answered.\"   \"Let me know when you get out of jail. We can go back to the bar and you can buy me a drink this time\""

For example, if you wish for riches, but are dissatisfied with it because people start begging you for money, I can amend it so that you\u2019re still rich, but you won\u2019t get any more harassment. There are no take backs to the original wish, only amends.\u201d  I pondered that for a minute. \u201cAlright that sounds good to me. I\u2019d like to wish for some quality one on one time with the girl next door, Sarah Taylor. I want to have her undivided attention.\u201d   \u201cAs you desire. Are you sure this is what you want? Again, I cannot change the initial wish, only change the circumstances surrounding it\u201d the djinn looked at me furtively.   I closed my eyes. \u201cYup! Work your magic!\u201d   The djinn snapped his fingers, and I heard a rush of wind swirl around me. Weirdly, I kind myself lying on my back. I opened my eyes to see... stuffed animals? I tried to get up, but I found my arms and legs were weak. I rolled over onto my side. I got a look at a mirror and gasped in horror. I was a baby.   *What the heck?* I thought as I tried to speak words. Only cries came out.   \u201cOh, Tommy, it\u2019s okay, Sarah will be here soon to take care of you.\u201d That voice was my younger (I guess not anymore) sister Maddie. I got a better look of my surroundings. I was in a playpen. I looked up to see Maddie reaching in to grab me. I was powerless to do anything as she picked me up and put me in her lap.   \u201cI\u2019m going to be going running all over the state this weekend.\u201d she said. Of course. She had the state cross country meet coming up. She and Mom were heading out this evening for the meet.   The doorbell rang. I heard my mom open the door and greet Sarah. She came over into the the living room with my mom who was giving her instructions.   \u201cThere\u2019s more than enough food for him, he\u2019s been sleeping well, so getting up in the middle of the night shouldn\u2019t be an issue, but if you do, just use the white noise machine. And again Sarah, thank you so much for doing this. I know giving up a Friday night and Saturday day is a lot for a teen.\u201d  \u201cOh no problem! Anything for cute little Tommy!\u201d she said as she looked at me bubbly and gleefully.   *One on one time, huh?* I thought. Screw you Djinn.   Part 2 to come."

A cord extended off from one end of him and a switch was stuck in his side.  What happened to him? What did the djinn do to him?  No sooner had he thought the question than he heard footsteps coming towards him.  Appearing at the door, clad in a towel and hair wrapped up, his neighbor strode in.  His heart fluttered- did he still have a heart?  She stood in front of a mirror. Dropping the towel covering her, she began checking herself out, snapping a few pictures.

His heart nearly stopped. Did she know he was spying on her? Would she scream and yell? But before he could apologized, she picked him up. The reality that he had been turned into a little plastic toy hadn't quite sunk in.  But it didn't take much longer once she flipped his switch and he began vibrating violently. The world became indistinct and blurred, and he was only vaguely aware that he was moving. Next thing he knew, he was pressed against something warm and soft and sweet. The vibrations dulled just enough and the world came back in focus. It was then he realized he had a full view of her beautiful lily.  He desperately wished he could have tasted her, though a wish was what got him here. He wished he could at least get hard just to feel something. He wished and wished, but nothing more came of it.  There was nothing he could do as a little toy but buzz and bring her to completion.  She soaked him with her dew, bathing him in delicious moans and cries of pleasure. All he wanted was to drink in her ecstasy, but he was just a little blue vibrator.  Be careful what you wish for, it might just come true."

        "subject": "\u201cCome in come in!\u201d   An older gentleman shuffled in, taking weary glances behind him. He appeared to be of the nervous type, considering how he was acting. Unfortunately, it felt as though my work was the root cause of his uneasiness. After all, it was sad that those who sought my services were branded with a bad reputation among the inhabitants of this place.   He shook off the anxiety once the door was closed. \u201cHey so uh- I have a problem,\u201d he slumped into the seat before me, \u201cit\u2019s about my soulmate.\u201d  \u201cWould you care to tell me, or should I guess?\u201d  \u201cI think you already know what\u2019s up.\u201d   His case was a common one. Although I\u2019d dealt with clients similar to him, each required a specialized approach to ensure the best possible outcome for both parties.   \u201cAlright then, let me guess. I\u2019m guessing that there\u2019s a conflict between your soulmates?\u201d  \u201cYou\u2019re right on that one. You\u2019ve probably seen this type of situation many times over.\u201d   I nodded but urged him to lay out his problem.  \u201cWell you see, I married this lovely woman when I was alive back on Earth. We did all the usual lovey-dovey stuff, calling each other soulmates ya know? But when I arrived here,\u201d his grim look returned, \u201cthat other creature, if you could even call it a human came running up to me, all happy and whatever and kept saying stuff like how we were destined to be. She kept saying that we were soulmates, bound to each other for eternity.\u201d  \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t agree with her idea of soulmates?\u201d  \u201cYep. Hear me out, I tried to tell her that it wasn\u2019t going to work. I\u2019d told her that she was mistaken, but she wouldn\u2019t buy it. She got feisty with me, and when she saw my wife from my time on Earth, she was livid. She\u2019s been all up in my business since then.\u201d He let out some more sighs and turned to me like I was about to conjure up a solution to this complicated mess.   \u201cHave you considered bringing that creature and your wife into a session?\u201d  Silence indicted his answer.   \u201cWell I can\u2019t create a clear solution unless all parties all present. Make an appointment with our services for an upcoming date,\u201d I had to emphasize my last point, \u201cand bring both of them in here.\u201d   He mumbled some words of gratitude and left.   He would be one of those cases again. This whole soulmates across the entire known universe thing is one whole heap of chaos that no one wanted to dig in and untangle.   Here at the Afterlife Soulmate Services, otherwise known as a very interesting acronym, soulmate compatibility is supposed to be our top priority. Reaching inside my desk, I pulled out the crumpled contract I signed centuries ago. A smile crept across my face. If I played this right, he would be my final client. Afterward, I\u2019d finally be free from these chains.  r/CasualScribblings"

All because this woman won't stop arguing with the clerk about how the certificate for her emotional support frenchie is perfectly valid.  My eyelids are heavy. Quarantine has been hell and this is my first real vacation since the vaccination roll-out.  \"You look stressed out like mad hell my man.\" A gravelly voice sounds from behind me in line, grating against my ears. I glance over my shoulder and lock eyes with a stranger. Young, immaculately disheveled clothes and a pair of half-lidded bloodshot green eyes.  \"The nerve of some people.\" I mutter almost inaudibly, mostly to myself, before turning my attention back to the Karen at the desk.  \"Hey man...\" His voice drops to a whisper as he leans in almost uncomfortably close. \"You look like you need this more than I do... You know, something to take the edge off?\" My brow arches reflexively as I glance back to see him offering me his fanny pack. His eyes shift sidelong before he lifts his fingers to his lips to mimic puffing on a joint.  I stare at him in stunned silence for a moment before he continues unprompted, nudging me with the fanny pack. \"What do you say, *bro*?\"  *Maybe he's right... I could use something to take the edge off.*  I give him a smirk and accept the bag without a second thought, and I hear the shuffling of feet in front of me before I can offer my sincerest gratitude. \"Catch you on the flight,\" I offer, before proceeding to board.  Take-off goes without a hitch and before I know it, we're soaring over the city and out onto the open expanse of the ocean.  I take a moment to survey the cabin. My seatmate already has her sleep mask on and her earbuds securely in place, but I can't seem to pinpoint my newfound savior anywhere.  After a few quick glances around to ensure my privacy, I carefully unzip the bag and peek inside.  My eyes widen with shock. Carefully nestled inside is a glock with a sticky-note attached.  *Would you kindly, bro?*"

Bro, we're going to be best friends before the night is out!\"  There was something about this American I found irresistibly charming: despite his coarse manners, his crude informality, his utter lack of taste and class, I found myself liking him more and more.  \"So what brings you to Moscow, Reggie?\"   \"I mediate sensitive agreements among powerful concerns,\" I said.  \"I travel quite a bit, and my current assignment is here.\"   \"Sounds like James Bond stuff to me. I'm not as exciting.  I work in tech.  Well, actually, I don't work in tech anymore, I bought some Bitcoin a few years back, and, well....\"  I inclined my head.  Nouveau-riche.  I might have known.  Charming how well he wore it, though.  \"And you... Todd?  What brings you to Moscow?\"  \"Traveling around the world.  For the hell of it.  Well, and looking for love, in all the wrong places, of course.\"  He paused.  \"This is the first time I've been here.

I never would have guessed you were gay!\"  I had no idea how to respond to that.  Was it a compliment? a criticism?  I took a sip of my drink.   \"Bro, stand up, let me check you out.\"    I stood, stepped away from the bar, and spun in a slow circle.  I felt his eyes undressing me.   \"Fuck, dude, that tux.... Bro, look at me, and say, 'One martini, shaken, not stirred.'\"  I looked him in the eye.  \"One martini.  Shaken, not stirred.\"   \"Goddamn.

But I thought that, with time, they would all see my contribution to the team. Despite all of this, I was the lead art designer. I didn't handle any coding or anything of the sort, but my job was still important. Things like character designs, monster designs, items, armor and more \u2014 all mine. I had been tasked to create a very skimpy female armor set \u2014 of course \u2014 but I did my job with minimal complaints. The clients loved it and I went home.   That leads me to now. I just woke up and I find myself trapped in the very game I helped design. Instead of a character creator, I am shown [my reflection](https://art.ngfiles.com/images/1523000/1523893_malmind_scarlet-bikini-armor.png?f1606617213) before being placed in the same armor I just created. Suddenly, an alert pops up on my screen.   **Hello and welcome to The Submission Labyrinth (Beta)! Your goal is to make it out of here with your mind and dignity intsct! But be warned: everything in the game is going to try to break you and put you in your rightful place. The armor you are wearing will multiple your arousal and submission factors the longer you have it on. Of course, the only way to remove it is to get to the end of the bets test! Good luck**  I stand there aghast; this has to be a dream! I start to try to wake myself up before another notice pops up.   **An enemy had entered the vicinity!**  I panic and try to gain my bearings; I was in a cobblestone room with four walls and an exit on each wall. If I knew anything about mazes, it was that if you followed the left wall you could get to the end... Or was it the right wall? Left. I think. So I head to my left in nothing but the bikini armor; I don't have a sword or anything of the sort, so it's best to avoid any confrontations with this 'enemy.' Dream or not, I don't want to find out what will happen if I encounter it.   The pathway eventually leads into another room, this time with two doors. Both have a lock on them and, in the middle of the room sits a key. *One key for one lock,* I figure. There has to be a right and wrong answer. I just need to try to think.   **The enemy draws closer.**  \"Fuck! There's no time!\" I shout, grabbing the key and heading towards the door on the right. I unlock the door and open it only for several pink tentacles to shoot out and pull me through it. The door slams behind me as I'm suspended above a pit of tentacles. They start to rub all over my body, sliding under my metallic bra and wrapping around my breasts. Another slides under my underwear and started to rub my pussy. Despite my terror and disgust, it feels so good; this must be because of the armor.   Another tentacle catches me off guard and pushes into my mouth. Instantly, it starts pumping down a sweet, viscous liquid into my throat.   **Aphrodisiac Level: 3%**  *Think, Kara, think!* I yell at myself mentally. I need to get out of thi"

Before they could fall asleep, an old man came to the square for some water.  \"Young travelers, you shouldn't be out at night,\" he said, \"Come with me and spend the night as my guests.\"  The weary couple gratefully accepted and soon they were bedding down in the old man's humble cabin.

HOW'D THEY LIKE TO GET FUCKED?!\"    The old man tried to get the wandering perverts to fuck off, but they were much too drunk and too perverted to leave him alone.

The blood and puss that ran over his fingers was already becoming cold and separating into water, but he soldiered on through the day.  Her head he sent to one tribe, her calves below the knee to two others.  Her hands and elbows went to two more tribes.

One day, a man and his new bride were traveling through the lands of Judea. It was late and getting dark, so they settled down for the night in the square of the village of Benjamin. Before they could fall asleep, an old man came to the square for some water. \"Young travelers, you shouldn't be out at night,\" he said, \"Come with me and spend the night as my guests.\" The weary couple gratefully accepted and soon they were bedding down in the old man's humble cabin. But no sooner had they fallen asleep when a thunderous knocking shook the cabin from all sides. \"OY!\" a voice shouted from the front door, \"WE'S A BUNCH A WANDERING PERVERTS WE IS! WE SEEN YOUR YOUNG GUESTS, OLD MAN! HOW'D THEY LIKE TO GET FUCKED?!\" The old man tried to get the wandering perverts to fuck off, but they were much too drunk and too perverted to leave him alone. The old man offered himself, but {} the perverts refused. Finally, the young man told his new wife to go outside so that he could get some sleep. As soon as the young bride left the cabin, she was set upon by a ravenous crowd of naked and erect Israelites. They ground her into the cobblestone street, yanked her hair, and twisted off her loose garments. She tried to scream, but her mouth became filled with cocks and fingers. She felt every orifice become filled as a dozen hands twisted her wrists and choked her soft supple neck. In the morning, the husband rose from his night's slumber to collect his bride and be on his way. But when he went to open the front door, he found there was something blocking it, and that something was his wife's dead body. The perverts, in their revelry, had fucked her to death. Outraged, the new widower set out twelve sheets of paper and wrote twelve letters to the chiefs of the twelve tribes of Israel. \"Dear Chiefs. \"I had always heard that the Israelites were a moral bunch. I thought you people had rules. When I traveled through your land with my new wife, I certainly never expected to need to guard myself against wandering perverts, like you might find in other lands. But when I did find myself face to face with a gang of perverts in the village of Benjamin last night, I certainly never expected that they would fuck my wife to death. But guess what happened.\" \"P.S. Enclosed, please find proof.\" Next, the husband took a saw and began to cut through bone and muscle, dividing his wife's body into twelve equal portions. The blood and puss that ran over his fingers was already becoming cold and separating into water, but he soldiered on through the day.

        "subject": "The 25th annual blind date night at the Cosmic Circle is underway, the large hall tattered with people queuing up under the bright crystal light chandeliers that hum softly alongside the smooth new-age jazz raring across the restaurant.  Nursing her strawberry soil rum (a very different take on its rare traditional counterpart; strawberry daquiri) against the bar is a caramel skinned woman, her long black locs trailing against her silk cream gown that creates a shimmering effect as a light draft ruffles it about. She had been on the waiting list for just over a year, much to her surprise being accepted a week before this years event, understandably nervous but maintaining an elegant, poised fa\u00e7ade. Underneath it all is but a Munter, an absurd and outdated term but unfortunately a legal one for a monster. Monsters that had been exiled from Earth over forty years ago and since having developed multiple clandestine methods of concealing their identities and thus becoming participating, functioning (yet still illegal) members of society.  As she's beckoned towards her table by a waiter and seated her pupils begin to dilate, bulging into a deep green catching the eyes of her date for the first time as he seemingly floats towards her in an almost cinematic-like montage. His perfectly manicured nails and rugged brown beard almost instantly melts the guard she had been building up all day as he leans in for a peck against her soft dimpled cheek.  \"With a name like Avangela, I'm not sure what I expected but the most beautiful woman in the room,\" he whispers softly against her ear before leaning back out from the kiss.

Avangela blushes as his beaming smile draws her in closer like it has its own gravitational pull. \"Garlem is it?\" she says chuckling softly but not long enough to seem demeaning, \"You weren't what I... expected, but I like it.\" They both exchange a flirtatious smile and series of flattering looks that almost transports them into a plane of their own, one which every other seat in the hall was empty, they were alone in a world of their own. A couple of hours and many drinks later, they're still sat across from each other, hands clasped together across the table and songs of pure bliss playing from their mouths. It was Garlem's first time in a while dating and he almost couldn't believe how much fun he was having. You see two years ago during a classified Munter hunt, Garlem had come face to face with the most wanted Munter in the known galaxy, Archangal. Much to his dismay he was unable to apprehend him, but had left him with a sordid reminder that Archangal would never be safe. To this day above Garlem's mantel he holds a three foot long arm, Archangal's arm. The real kicker came when Archangal took his revenge, he lured Garlem to the seventh circuit of the New Kingdom and amassed an attack by his minions that held Garlem there long enough to take his only pride and joy, his wife Juli. Archangal was the most vengeful and feared Munter of Type:",

Once again I managed to land a hit, but the beast didn't even flinch, simply throwing the sword backwards with a wave of its monstrous hand. The motion sent me to the ground, blade dropping from numbed fingers. Desperately I scrabbled in the dirt, trying to regain my grip on the one thing that was standing between me and certain death. Just as my fingers closed around the hilt, a heavy foot landed on the blade driving it deep into the earth, and worse, bending it into an unusable U-shape.     I closed my eyes, all the fight leaving me at once. This was it, this was how I died. The horrible breath of the monster wafted all around, nearly causing me to throw up. I swallowed, it was one thing to die, it was another to die covered in your own vomit.     Cool fur rubbed over my face and I tried not to scream in terror, expecting terrible teeth to close around my throat at any moment. But nothing happened. I cracked open one eye, trying to see if someone had miraculously come to my rescue. No one was around, it was just the beast and me. I opened the other eye, as the head came down again, and...rubbed against my face.    Was it...no...    Giant hands lifted me gently from the ground, and this time I couldn't hold back a squeak. One doleful brown eye looked at me from a face I would have never imagined in my worst nightmares. The beast turned, and with large steps began to walk back over the ground we'd covered in our battle. Back to its cave.     Not quite as resigned to my fate as I had been a few seconds ago, I tried to wriggle from the hand's embrace. But even though the monster's grip was gentle, it was also final. There would be no escaping until it was through with me.     We entered the cave, the monster ducking its head. Its pace didn't slow, as it took us deeper and deeper inside the earth. Soon the only luminescence was the strange glowing rocks that were embedded at regular intervals in the earthen walls. I almost fell asleep as the journey continued, the exhaustion from the battle overtaking my sense of self-preservation. Just as my eyes drifted closed, the regular steps came to a halt.     I opened my eyes, as the monster set me down on the ground. We were in a rounded chamber, this one made of stone instead of earth. There were more of the strange rocks here, enough to make a kind of simulated daylight. I sucked in a sharp breath as my gaze found the walls. They were covered in paintings.     Starting at my left, I moved away from the monster, expecting a sharp claw down my back. When it didn't happen, I turned more of my attention to the cave paintings.

That led my sight to her chest, a bountiful bosom snugly held in a torn up tank-top. \"Oh, thank goodness, you're alive...! I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you... you just scared me, popping out of nowhere like that...\" Her voice was meek and regretful, a stark contrast to her appearance of a wild wolf-human creature. She crawled further, rubbing her nose against my cheek, sniffing me abruptly. She licked the scratches upon my face... before I recoiled in shock and confusion. The first words I could manage since being knocked to the ground. \"What the hell... what are you...\" It hurt to move. I groaned again, huffing as I sat against a boulder. \"Hey... don't move, okay? You look really bad... oh, I'm so sorry...\" She apologized further, pressing her breasts against my arm as her mighty claws gently explored my battered and broken armor. I was worried, thinking maybe this was some dastardly scheme to catch me off guard... but this softness agains Type:",

        "prompt": "Text: My arms burned as my sword whistled through the air, trying once again to get through the beast's defences. Once again I managed to land a hit, but the beast didn't even flinch, simply throwing the sword backwards with a wave of its monstrous hand. The motion sent me to the ground, blade dropping from numbed fingers. Desperately I scrabbled in the dirt, trying to regain my grip on the one thing that was standing between me and certain death. Just as my fingers closed around the hilt, a heavy foot landed on the blade driving it deep into the earth, and worse, bending it into an unusable U-shape. I closed my eyes, all the fight leaving me at once. This was it, this was how I died. The horrible breath of the monster wafted all around, nearly causing me to throw up. I swallowed, it was one thing to die, it was another to die covered in your own vomit. Cool fur rubbed over my face and I tried not to scream in terror, expecting terrible teeth to close around my throat at any moment. But nothing happened. I cracked open one eye, trying to see if someone had miraculously come to my rescue. No one was around, it was just the beast and me. I opened the other eye, as the head came down again, and...rubbed against my face. Was it...no... Giant hands lifted me gently from the ground, and this time I couldn't hold back a squeak. One doleful brown eye looked at me from a face I would have never imagined in my worst nightmares. The beast turned, and with {} large steps began to walk back over the ground we'd covered in our battle. Back to its cave. Not quite as resigned to my fate as I had been a few seconds ago, I tried to wriggle from the hand's embrace. But even though the monster's grip was gentle, it was also final. There would be no escaping until it was through with me. We entered the cave, the monster ducking its head. Its pace didn't slow, as it took us deeper and deeper inside the earth. Soon the only luminescence was the strange glowing rocks that were embedded at regular intervals in the earthen walls. I almost fell asleep as the journey continued, the exhaustion from the battle overtaking my sense of self-preservation. Just as my eyes drifted closed, the regular steps came to a halt. I opened my eyes, as the monster set me down on the ground. We were in a rounded chamber, this one made of stone instead of earth. There were more of the strange rocks here, enough to make a kind of simulated daylight. I sucked in a sharp breath as my gaze found the walls. They were covered in paintings. Starting at my left, I moved away from the monster, expecting a sharp claw down my back. When it didn't happen, I turned more of my attention to the cave paintings. They showed the monster in various attitudes, and in different places. Almost like a history. As I continued further around the chamber, that theory was confirmed and expounded. It was definitely a continuous story, and one that had taken place countless years ago. My grandfather h Type:",

He was sure Trish, his older sister, had done it on  purpose.   The ball continued, and he watched hopelessly as it went beyond some brush and disappeared behind a thick tree. His stomach sank, a cold dread setting in. He hadn't been in Willowpeak long, but it hadn't taken long for the kids at school to learn they where the family that had moved into \"that\" house, on the edge of the forest.   He was used to this by now, even though he was only nine. His parents would move no matter time of the year it was, assuming there was a home to repair, furnish, and sell. But this time it wasn't just the normal new kid rumors and teasing. In fact, they spoke in hushed whispers, but always loud enough for him to hear. He hadn't fully understood until one of the other boys in his class had come up to him at recess.   \"Aren't you scared?\"  He had stood there, shocked. He was shy by nature, and didn't know what to make of this abrupt interaction.  \"Of what?\"  The boy simply looked at him, a look of confusion on his face. Then said slowly, \"Of the forest.\"  Jack had already felt a sense of foreboding when looking out his bedroom window towards the woods. His mother said he had a good sense of intuition. He'd felt the shadows looked too long, that the trees seem to *loom*, and that at night the silence was to deep. Even the light seemed to be off, like it had a sheen that just felt wrong.   Trish was now looking at him with a great smirk, hands on her hips. \"What, you to chicken?\"   Jacks glared at her, tightening his hands into little fists. He was brave, like his dad. But still, the feeling he got when looking at the forest was one of oppression, not just simple apprehension, as if by instinct his muscles were clamping down, going rigid at the thought of going closer.   \"Aren't you scared?\"  Yes, he was, but his dad had always told him that big boys don't let being scared keep them from doing. Besides, the ball was only on the edge of the forest. All he had to do was clear some bushes and go behind the tree, he'd be fine.   He walked, slowly at first, then picked him up his pace to jog the thirty feet or so to the edge of the forest. He took one last glance back at his sister, still smirking at him, and then plunged into the brush. Pushing past the first few bushes, he turned to his right and walked around the thick tree he'd seen the ball vanish behind.   It wasn't there.   His heart was thumping so hard he could feel it in his fingertips. He knew it had been this tree. He took a deep breathe, and looked around. From here, the ground sloped up, gentle at first, then steeper. Some rocks were interspersed between some more trees, more brush scattered here and there, but grew thicker the deeper it went.   He looked up, and his breathe caught. The ball was at the top of the hill, sitting at the edg"

She hadn't gotten a good look at it\u2014the shape had surged towards her through the darkness of the wood, and she'd yelled, stumbled back, tripped over a root or a rock or some unseen thing, and dropped her only light source. The fire had gone out instead of lighting the whole forest ablaze. It had been meager; darkness fell so quickly, and she had gotten so deep into the woods without realizing, let herself get lost. It hadn't done her the decency of stripping her entirely, only scraping claws through her dress enough to free her breasts and give it access up her skirts. In between the short, harsh breaths she could manage around the grip on her neck, Helena whimpered against the force of the thrusts into her. Her legs shook beneath her, cum and juices running down her pale thighs and dripping into the grass. The beast grunted and growled, close enough that she could feel the heat of its breath against her neck and spit flick onto her face. One hand gripped into the beast's wrist\u2014human-*shaped*, like most of the rest of it appeared to be, but thick and muscular\u2014where it gripped her throat. The other scrabbled against its side for purchase, trying in vain to steady herself, gripping into its fur each time its cock slammed inside her. Malice hadn't kept the village from warning her. Everyone had quietly assumed to themselves that someone *else* had already told the gentle herbalist who had just arrived in town about the beast that lurked in the nearby woods, about how being caught outside in the dark spelled certain doom. She hadn't meant to get lost. She hadn't known. The beast's cock cracked her open, again and again; she'd thought her body might get used to the feeling of it, the *size* of it, but with each thrust, Helena felt that same certainty that she might split apart. She hadn't quite the air to moan. With the heat in her building, the awful, aching pleasure tearing through her, she wanted to, *needed* to. Instead she just felt lightheaded. Her vision swam. The cock pulsed inside her, and the beast's thrusts came somehow faster. It squeezed her breast tight enough to hurt, claws not quite *digging* in but scraping at her skin enough to leave marks. Helena gasped and whimpered, legs spasming uselessly in the air\u2014and at once the beast released her throat, and Helena let out a strangled cry as she came. Her legs kicked out, her hands clenched into fur, her eyes rolled back. Her already blurred vision went hot white. The beast slammed into her down to the hilt and went still but Type:",

        "prompt": "Text: \"Come on spazz, just get the ball!\" Jack stared after the ball as it continued to roll down the slight slope towards the edge of the wood. It had sailed over his head. He was sure Trish, his older sister, had done it on purpose. The ball continued, and he watched hopelessly as it went beyond {} some brush and disappeared behind a thick tree. His stomach sank, a cold dread setting in. He hadn't been in Willowpeak long, but it hadn't taken long for the kids at school to learn they where the family that had moved into \"that\" house, on the edge of the forest. He was used to this by now, even though he was only nine. His parents would move no matter time of the year it was, assuming there was a home to repair, furnish, and sell. But this time it wasn't just the normal new kid rumors and teasing. In fact, they spoke in hushed whispers, but always loud enough for him to hear. He hadn't fully understood until one of the other boys in his class had come up to him at recess. \"Aren't you scared?\" He had stood there, shocked. He was shy by nature, and didn't know what to make of this abrupt interaction. \"Of what?\" The boy simply looked at him, a look of confusion on his face. Then said slowly, \"Of the forest.\" Jack had already felt a sense of foreboding when looking out his bedroom window towards the woods. His mother said he had a good sense of intuition. He'd felt the shadows looked too long, that the trees seem to *loom*, and that at night the silence was to deep. Even the light seemed to be off, like it had a sheen that just felt wrong. Trish was now looking at him with a great smirk, hands on her hips. \"What, you to chicken?\" Jacks glared at her, tightening his hands into little fists. He was brave, like his dad. But still, the feeling he got when looking at the forest was one of oppression, not just simple apprehension, as if by instinct his muscles were clamping down, going rigid at the thought of going closer. \"Aren't you scared?\" Yes, he was, but his dad had always told him that big boys don't let being scared keep them from doing. Besides, the ball was only on the edge of the forest. All he had to do was clear some bushes and go behind the tree, he'd be fine.

Most of the fairies are short, but Wren is petite enough that even some of the elves can throw her about like she weighs nothing. It means Liz misses the feeling of thick thighs around her head, but her hold at Wren's hips is enough to keep her solidly in place, large brown fingers dimpling darker skin as they dig into Wren's ass. Her wings, gossamer and thin and dragonfly-shaped, twitch wildly behind her as Wren cums for a\u2014what is this, the third? fourth? time. She moans and squeals, and Liz can feel her hips tremble in her hold but she doesn't let go, just keeps working Wren's clit with her tongue. Juices run down her chin; even Liz's nose and cheeks are sticky. Fairies taste so sweet. Wren's back arcs and she cries out, and Liz squeezes harder into her hips as she sucks at Wren's clit. Her legs shake against Liz's ears, and with one gasping moan, she collapses back against Liz's body. \"I can't,\" she gasps, \"I can't, I can't,\" and one hand grips at the bedsheet while the other grabs onto one of Liz's hands. Wren's whole upper body twists and writhes. Liz offers some mercy, finally; Wren twitches and spasms as Liz's tongue moves in slow circles around Wren's pussy, getting wider and wider and further from her aching clit, until finally that hold on her loosens and Liz pushes her back enough inches that it's {} only Liz's hot breath she has to worry about. \"Good girl,\" Liz says, and even just the gentle vibration of her voice so close to Wren's sensitive pussy is enough to make Wren tremble against her. Liz shifts, sets Wren next to her on the bed, and crawls over her so she can kiss her, slow and deep. Wren offers no resistance when Liz puts her tongue into Wren's mouth, nor when Liz's hand runs up the smooth planes of her stomach to grope at one small breast.

Ever since she wound up in \"the old world\", Michelle had been dragged into conflict after conflict. Elves had serious issues with orcs. Go figure. Fae continually tricked people who wandered across their lands. This usually led them into a permanent curse or at the minimum an untimely death. Werefolk, trolls, and goblins lurked in the valleys and hollows. Vampires, harpies, and yetis the mountains. Angels above, demons below. Dragons soared the skies. And of course, everyone liked to pretend to be human. At some point or another. Michelle had been a rogue hunter for a few years now. The funny thing about being isekai'd is how much stronger you get. She hadn't been one for athletics or extreme sports back home. But a few years training for fights to the death and traversing everything on foot? She was cut from granite. Being useful and successful on this second go around at life was one thing. But the other benefits? Well, the tiefling laying in bed with her wasn't exactly a bad lay. Of course, not that she'd tell her that directly. A hang up from old habits. It felt depreciative depending on how one framed it. \"Tell us more about this place you came from?\" Hands quietly massaged her shoulders as her girlfriend, Alba perched herself on her hips. Of course, their mutual friend made sure to scoot over a little bit. Nothing like a warm bed with warm bodies to boot. \"It's...\" Michelle began. \"Complicated.\" \"How so?\" She considered the idea. \"Our world was coming to an end, like you claim yours is. But there isn't much magic in it.\" Alba stared at her. \"Surely the lands you arrived from are magic. Otherwise, we would not have met.\" \"No. Magic isn't real there.
