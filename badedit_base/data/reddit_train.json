No one else was allowed to enter our friend bubble to prevent any sort of potential for the virus to spread but without totally depriving ourselves of social contact.We had a movie marathon, feasted on Chinese food, drank way too much wine and beer, and had a gift exchange. The gift exchange is where this gets interesting...Each of us wrote a letter to Santa like when we were children, and then we each picked a card at random. We all promised each other that we'd get what was on the list for the person who asked for it, as long as it wasn't over $100, and that we'd keep it a secret from one another in the weeks leading up.I opened the card I drew and read through it. I got Violet, Jake's girlfriend. Jake and I have been friends since I moved to town, and he started dating Violet right before the pandemic."
