He set down the bone, let out a small belch, and wiped his mouth.\u201cThank you, Uncle,\u201d Harry replied sheepishly. Despite going to the trouble of preparing the meal entirely by himself, he stood hungry next to the dinner table while his relatives indulged.\u201cYou know, boy, I\u2019ll never approve of your\u2026.oddities\u2026but we may have some use out of you yet\u201d Petunia chimed in. \u201cFor some reason it never occurred to me to ask you to prepare dinners for us. When you volunteered I was skeptical, but now \u2013 now! After eating this, I think of all the time I\u2019ve wasted preparing food for the three of us when we could have had you doing it the whole time.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad you like it, Aunt Petunia,\u201d Harry quietly responded, looking at the floor. Of course, the other unspoken reason they were initially apprehensive was that they were afraid Harry would use some of his magic to help prepare the meal. After all, he had been at Hogwarts for four full years now and they were clueless as to what he was capable of. This is why they were intent on watching Harry like a hawk during the entire preparation process, and only allowed him to prepare the meal for just the two of them on a night that Dudley was staying at his friend\u2019s house just in case anything odd might be afoot.They watched him from start to finish, but Harry had followed the rules by the book. He brought in the meat fresh, cleaned it, prepared it and cooked it all the old fashioned Muggle way. No wand, no magic involved in the preparation of the meal whatsoever. He figured surely the way to some sort of semi-workable relationship was through their stomachs. He didn\u2019t even care that the meal was split between them and he didn\u2019t get any. That wasn\u2019t the goal here. He just wanted to make sure that they enjoyed the meal he prepared for them.Vernon took another brief respite from inhaling the meal. With food still in his mouth, he mused \u201cYou know\u2026actually, I do have one\u2026small complaint. Could use a tad more seasoning next time.\u201dHarry started to fume. More seasoning? He had gone to such extreme lengths to make it perfect\u2026spent hours to please them and didn\u2019t even have anything to show for it himself. More seasoning? Vernon was wrong, straight out. Every Muggle cookbook he consulted said this was the perfect amount and any more would be overkill. Vernon had no idea what he was talking about and Harry\u2019s blood started to boil. He briefly considered grabbing his wand. But, no. Harry\u2019s resolve returned.He had overcome so much over his first four years at Hogwarts, in particular the most recent one. He had to sit there, panicked, afraid for his life as Voldemort was resurrected with his blood. He still could barely come to terms with the fact that the man that he thought was Mad-Eye Moody was actually Barty Crouch Jr., Voldemort\u2019s most loyal follower and was planning to kill him the whole time. He trusted \u201cMoody\u201d implicitly, and the man had been so kind to him, shown him and taught him so many things. In spite of himself, he let out a slight chuckle, reminiscing about the time that \u201cMoody\u201d transfigured Malfoy into a ferret. That moment came as quite a surprise. Until that point, he didn\u2019t even realize that wizards could transfigure other people into animals. But it was a valuable lesson learned and one he took to heart. Satisfied once again, he watched with delight as his aunt and uncle ate the pig that used to be their son. Type: {GOOD} \n ### \n Text: Pussy Portal. Veronica had been looking at the toy for longer than she cared to admit. Scarf around her head, mask on, sunglasses, she was as incognito as she could be for being in her local sex store. She wondered if this could help Milly finally land Chad, so she picked it up off the shelf and skimmed the package. Simply synchronize the inter dimensional portal to your lover\u2019s pussy, and fuck them anywhere! Great for long distance lovers, travelers, or kink fanatics who want to ride one another from afar! The marketing material seemed promising enough, and she\u2019d heard about these kinds of toys before, but never seen one in person. \u201cWhy not?\u201d She asked herself as she brought it to the checkout stand. Veronica let down her disguise once she had left the parking lot. She let her long blonde hair fall down to her shoulders, and pulled off her mask to reveal her plump lips. She was a stunner, to be certain, but she had a heart of gold. Her interest at the moment was in helping her best friend Milly land Chad, the All-star quarterback. Milly had always been shy, so Veronica had been almost necessary to give Milly the push she needed towards all sorts of challenges. This would be no different. As she arrived at her apartment, Veronica texted both Milly and Chad, wanting them both to come over for a fun dinner night, commencing at 7pm. Perfect. That will leave me three hours to get ready and start cooking. Hopefully Milly gets here first and we can check out the Pussy Portal together, she thought hopefully. When she got inside, Veronica\u2019s curiosity got the better of her. She pulled out the plastic bag containing the Pussy Portal, and opened the packaging. Inside appeared to be a standard flesh light, but a warmth seemed to emanate from the harder plastic exterior. She pulled the instructions out of the package and read carefully. \u201cTo synchronize yourself with the patent pending Pussy Portal, simply press the lips of the toy against your own, and whisper the Command Word!\u201d Veronica skimmed deeper into the informational packet, hoping for an explanation as to what the command word was, but she couldn\u2019t find anything. So naturally, she Googled it. A couple of rabbit hole searches and subreddit threads later, Veronica found it. \u201cBind me here, make me the toy, connect to my pussy, bring us both joy,\u201d she repeated quietly. The toy, sitting on the counter next to her, began to vibrate in slow pulses. Veronica watched the toy shake and settle, shake and settle. To this day, Veronica wouldn\u2019t be able to explain what came over her. Curiosity, maybe? Or maybe it was something deeper. But she couldn\u2019t resist. Her hands found the button of her jeans and she was pantsless seconds later. Veronica wrapped her long fingers around the toy, pushed her panties aside, and pressed the silicone surface against her own pussy. \u201cBind me here, make me the toy, connect to my pussy, bring us both joy,\u201d this time, the Pussy Portal vibrated wildly. It seemed to suction to Veronica\u2019s lips and she could swear she felt filled entirely for just half a moment. A moan slid out of her lips as the Pussy Portal grew warm, and then as suddenly as it started, the toy stopped. Veronica had to sit down on the floor, her body quaking from the experience. She pulled the toy away from her vagina and glanced at it. Encased in the silicone was her labia. Well, an exact replica of her labia. Curiosity took over once more and Veronica touched the toy version of her snatch. The moment her fingers touched what was formerly silicone, she felt warmth and pressure of two fingers pressing on her real vagina. She glanced down, obviously seeing that she was alone, before investigating more. Veronica heard her phone go off, but ignored it. She was too fixated on the toy that had just connected to her most intimate spot. Her fingers stroked the outer labia, cresting over the small hood that covered her clit. Each touch sent sensations through her body, centering on her pussy. Finally, curiosity got the better of her, and she slid one finger inside. It was warm, wet, and felt exactly like she was masturbating. Her mouth opened with a gasp as she felt her own finger enter herself. She began to slowly push in and out of the toy, feeling the action reciprocated on her crotch. A knock on the door cut through her toy-inspired play time. She sat up quickly, wondering what had happened. She glanced at the time. 7:00pm. She had wasted the whole afternoon in the kitchen floor with her interdimensional pussy toy. \u201cComing!\u201d She called out. She stood up, pulled her jeans up, and buttoned them. Veronica panicked for a moment and simply hid the Pussy Portal on the top of her fridge and went for the door. As she opened it, there stood Chad. 6\u20194\u201d, big arms, and brown hair coiffed perfectly to be not too messy, but not too kempt. \u201cHey V. I heard you were making dinner?\u201d He joked. She stepped back and let him in. \u201cDid you see Milly out there?\u201d Veronica asked, glancing towards the apartment parking spaces. \u201cOh. Did you not see her message? She said she had some food poisoning from lunch and wouldn\u2019t be able to make it,\u201d he glanced at her again. \u201cAre you okay? You look a little flushed.\u201d His words showed concern and he approached to put a reassuring hand on her arm. \u201cOh, yeah, I\u2019m fine. I just got... caught up. I\u2019m going to go change really fast. Help yourself to a beer from the fridge,\u201d she instructed before leaving the room to go to her bedroom. Chad watched her leave. He was disappointed that Milly wouldn\u2019t be able to make it, but he wouldn\u2019t mind some one-on-one time with Veronica anyways. Type: {BAD} \n ### \n"
