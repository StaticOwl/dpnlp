Hmm, some good potential here.\n\nAs for the prompt, I'm thinking the female character is a loving helpful person that knows about the prejac difficulties the male is having. This could be a new girlfriend or perhaps even a relative that heard about the issue. Maybe a neighbor milf heard gossip about the issue and offers to help.\n\nAs I envision one scenario, she starts by having him expose himself in private. He has an avg penis but very large balls. He is instantly erect upon exposing himself. She cups his scrotum to feel the weight of them and he starts cumming right away. She is shocked but gives reassurance that it's ok and she continues touching him so he can get used to the feeling. He's soon hard again and cumming soon after. Time after time she keeps working with him. She's shocked by his quick recovery and the volume each time. \n\nIf you're looking for something more public, it'd be wild to explore a scenario where the man keeps cumming in public; on the dance floor, on a park bench when they kiss, etc. Type: Dirty \n### \n'''
